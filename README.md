Adhesive
----------------
Adhesive is designed to be a very light, portable utility that allows you to easily call functions from any other language.

Running examples
---------------
First, fire up a new terminal, create an empty folder for your project, go into that folder, and type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JacksonCoder/adhesive
```

To compile the C++ program, type:
```bash
make app
```
To test the python script, type:
```bash
python test.py
```

The output should be:
```bash
_ADHESIVERETURN:({[ADHES:Hello
]})
```
